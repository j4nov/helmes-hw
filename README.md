# Sector submission task

This project consists of two separate parts: the **backend** and **frontend**. Each part has its own setup instructions. Follow the instructions for both parts to get the project up and running.

### Backend Setup

The backend is built with Symfony and handles all the API logic. To set up the backend, follow the instructions in the `backend/README.md` file.

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is built with React. To set up the frontend, follow the instructions in the `frontend/README.md` file.

### Notes:
- After setting up the backend, make sure to run migrations and fill the `sector` table with fixtures.
- The frontend and backend are designed to run independently, but they work together to form a full-stack application.
